<h1 align="center">OpenWeatherMap APP</h1> </p>

### Background
Build a web app and an API Endpoint using Appcelerator Arrow. The Endpoint should return the 5 day
forecast, while the web app will have to display this information to the user.
Both, the web part and endpoint must use one installment of Arrow. Which means, that the Arrow app
should consist of at least one Route and one API.
You can use OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather conditions and forecasts.

### Requirements
- The API endpoint should provide weather forecast information for the next 5 days
- This data is retrieved from a remote service (e.g. OpenWeatherMap)
- Additionally a location based filter could be added to the API
- The Endpoint should use ‘basic’ authentication
- The web app should display 5 day forecast (retrieved from the API endpoint) and the two highest and lowest temperatures for that period.
- Reduce data received from API endpoint to get the highest and lowest temperatures

You can choose the forecast location, preferably use user’s current location.
Beyond the requirements listed above the developer is free to modify or enhance the application as
desired.

### Deliverables
The Application must be made available on Github as a public repository. The application must run.
