# appc.openweathermap
Build a web app and an API Endpoint using Appcelerator Arrow. The Endpoint should return the 5 day forecast, while the web app will have to display this information to the user. Both, the web part and endpoint must use one installment of Arrow. Which means, that the Arrow app should consist of at least one Route and one API. You can use OpenWeatherMap API to get current weather conditions and forecasts.
